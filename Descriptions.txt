Use the AA tool with A2019 Community Edition (For students or developers).

In this version, its features are limited when working with IQ Bot, you can only upload up to 10 documents for training,
after training, you can not upload bot to the production environment, you cannot export the bot ...

You can try the AA tool with version 11, which is an older version than the A2019 version so there will be some changes.
